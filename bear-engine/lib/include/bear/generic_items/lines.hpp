   * \brief A class to create several bear::line.
   *
   * bear::line has to adjust its size to fit all the items to be sure
   * they are displayed. If the set of items is large enough,
   * bear::line tends to cover the whole world. bear::lines will
   * create several instances of bear::line, one for each pair of
   * successive items, each one will thus be restricted to a small
   * part of the world.
   *
   * One reason to not use this class instead of bear::line is that
   * the whole line will be broken if one item dies, whereas
   * bear::line would just adapt the line to the remaining items.
   *
   * The custom fields of this class are:
   * - ends (list of items): the ends of the segments of the lines,
   * - width (real): the width of the lines (default = 1).
   *
