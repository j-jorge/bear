     *  - \a actor: (item) the item to which and to the clones of which
     *    the movement is applied (default = none),
     *  - \a count: (unsigned int) the number of clones to create (default = 0),
     *  - \a delay: (real) the time interval between the placement of two
     *    clones,
     *  - \a movement: (item) \b [required] \c an item having a movement
     *    applied to him, the movement that will be applied to the actor,
     *  - \a auto_remove: (bool) \c tell if the movement removes himself
     *    from the moving item when finished (default = false).
     *  - \a auto_remove: (bool) Tell if the angle of moving items are
     *    updated according to their angular speed (default = false).
     *  - ratio.x: real, the ratio of width to compute actor's position
     *    (0 for left side, 0.5 for middle, 1 for right side). (default = 0.5)
     *  - ratio.y: real, the ratio of height to compute actor's position
     *    (0 for bottom side, 0.5 for middle, 1 for top side). (default = 0.5)
     *  - gap.x: real, The x-gap to applied. (default = 0)
     *  - gap.y: real, The y-gap to applied. (default = 0)
